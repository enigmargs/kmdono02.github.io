I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  
I work on developing methods to conduct statistical inference on brain connectivity using independent components analysis.
<br/><br/>
Through my work at the <a href="http://www.cidd.unc.edu/">Carolina Institute of Developmental Disabilities</a>, I
  <ul>
    <li>Use machine learning in to predict future autism diagnosis in infants based on behavioral and brain image data</li>
    <li>Conduct inference on associations between autism diagnosis, behavioral outcomes, and brain measures</li>
    <li>Teach statistical concepts and programming with R</li>
    <li>Created a <a href="https://kmdono02.github.io/Data_Analysis_with_R_IBIS/">handbook</a> on statistical concepts and R programming</li>
  </ul>

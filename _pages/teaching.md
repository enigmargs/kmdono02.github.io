**Statistics and R Programming with IBIS (2020-2021)**  
Material for course designed to teach fundamental statistic concepts, analytical methods, and carrying out data management and analysis using R software.  Focus is placed on learning R as a **language** and not simply memorizing specific commands, to allow one to tackle examples beyond what are covered in the course, and on relating the R code back to the corresponding statistical concept.  First, links to the main text source for the tutorials and corresponding R code (R code as RMD files) are provided.<br/>
